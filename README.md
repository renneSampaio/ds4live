# ds4live

ds4live is a tool that sends DualShock 4 events as OSC/MIDI messages.

It's still in really early development. I am currently only targeting linux, but may add Windows support in the future.

# Goals
[] Capture DS4 events using hdiapi
[] Send OSC messages
[] Send MIDI messages
[] Create cli application with support for configurable events
[] Create gui application
